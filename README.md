# Solana Tools

A collection of simple, open-source Solana developer tools and scripts.  
Built by Kevin Smits while learning and experimenting in the Solana ecosystem.

## What you’ll find here (soon)
- Token metadata / supply fetchers  
- Wallet + SPL token readers  
- Burn verification tools  
- RPC examples  
- Small dashboard components  

Everything is kept simple and reusable for other builders.

## Status
🚧 Work in progress — first tools will be added here soon.
