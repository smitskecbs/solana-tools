# Solana Tools

A modern TypeScript monorepo by Kevin Smits for read-only SPL token intelligence on Solana mainnet.

## Philosophy

- On-chain transparency
- Holder distribution insights
- CLI-first developer utilities
- Read-only intelligence, no wallet connections or private keys

## Whale Tracker

Scan the largest wallet holders for any SPL token mint and compare distribution changes between snapshots.

### Highlights
- Mainnet holder ranking by size
- Percentage ownership per wallet
- Safe snapshot diffing (previous to current)
- JSON export ready for dashboards or API use
- Fully read-only (no keys, no approvals)

## Ecosystem

Other tooling categories in this monorepo include SPL mint reading, account inspection, pool analysis, and snapshot exports, built to simplify Solana Web3 flows for developers and community moderators.

## Usage goal

Deliver consolidated, lightweight on-chain intelligence for token founders, developers, and mods, in a single command or clean integration.

## Structure
